<p>Ok, new thing.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>Add parallax scrolling so that the top quote panel scrolls slower than the big blue masthead panel.
To do this I might need to also set a top margin for the masthead panel.</p>

<p>Make the buy tickets button stick at the top of the page when it gets there.</p>
